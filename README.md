# Weather-Application
This project is a Weather Application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to check the current weather conditions for any location around the world. The app fetches real-time weather data from an API (weather.API.com) and displays information like temperature,  weather conditions. The app provides a simple and interactive user interface with dynamic styling and updates based on the location input.

1. HTML (Structure)
HTML provides the basic structure of the weather app. It defines the elements where the weather data will be displayed and where the user interacts with the app (e.g., input fields for the location and a button to trigger the data fetch).

User Input: The app contains an input field where users can enter the name of the city or use geolocation features to get the weather.
Weather Information: The app displays key weather details, such as temperature,  an icon representing the weather condition.
Layout Structure: The layout is structured using containers, divs, and forms for user interaction and displaying results.

2. CSS (Styling & Layout)
CSS is used to style the weather app, ensuring it is visually appealing and easy to use. This includes designing the layout, color scheme etc.

Buttons and Inputs: The input field and button are styled to match the design, with hover effects and focus states for a better user experience.


3. JavaScript (Functionality & Data Fetching)
JavaScript is used to handle the logic and interactivity of the weather app. It enables dynamic updates and fetching of real-time weather data from a weather API.

API Request: JavaScript is used to send requests to the weather API based on the user's input (city name ).
Parsing Data: The returned data is parsed and displayed . JavaScript extracts specific information like temperature, weather conditions from the API response.
